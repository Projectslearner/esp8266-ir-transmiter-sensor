# ESP8266 IR Transmitter Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The ESP8266 IR Transmitter Sensor project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller with an IR LED to transmit infrared signals. This setup allows the ESP8266 to send commands to devices that are controlled via IR, such as TVs, air conditioners, and other consumer electronics. By encoding and emitting IR signals, the ESP8266 can replicate remote control functionality.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **IR LED**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the IR LED:**
   - **Anode (+):** Connect to GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266 through a current-limiting resistor.
   - **Cathode (-):** Connect to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure the IR codes you want to transmit are correctly defined in the code.

2. **Transmission:**
   - The example code sends an NEC protocol (standard TV remote) power ON signal (`0x20DF10EF`). Replace this with the IR code corresponding to the command you want to transmit.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to confirm successful transmission of the IR signal.

#### Applications
- **Home Automation:** Control IR-based devices through an ESP8266-based automation system.
- **IoT Integration:** Integrate IR control into IoT projects for remote device management.
- **Custom Remote Controls:** Develop custom remote controls for specific applications using ESP8266.

#### Notes
- **IR Code Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility between the transmitted IR codes and the target device's IR receiver.
- **Line-of-Sight:** Maintain a clear line-of-sight between the IR LED and the target device for reliable transmission.
- **Library Usage:** Explore additional features and protocols supported by the IRremoteESP8266 library for advanced IR applications.
